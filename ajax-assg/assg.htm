        For this assignment, we have to create a live server and then run the code on port 5500 as: 127.0.0.1:5500/ajax-assg/assg.html
        <br> For me, I added live server extension in my VS code and then ran the code by Starting Live Server (by right clicking). Then in browser ran the code on above mentioned port.
        <br> This was done because of CORS Policy error.
